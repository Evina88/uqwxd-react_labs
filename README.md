2. Worked on react-redux-master creating increment counter Application using Redux in React.

Used state management to increment the counter using Redux. Redux library has all that it requires for store management while react-redux binds react and redux libraries together. It centralizing an application’s state and logic, thereby making the state accessible outside of the component.

The store management with redux has 3 main components:

Actions - are blocks of information that send data from your application to your store. Actions must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

Reducers -Reducers specify how the application’s state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

Store -The Store is the object that brings the action and reducer together. The store has the following responsibilities: Holds application state; Allows access to state; Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action);
